            <p class="indented">As Lead Expo my job is to act as a network firewall and router for food in the kitchen. I am responsible for ensuring the food is cooked and plated properly (if not I send it back), accounted for in our digital ticket system so that the same dish is not made twice, and communicate with both Back of House and Front of House to deliver food to the proper tables in a timely manner. In times of extreme business I maintain my ability to think clearly and effectively, acting as the glue that assures mission-critical services are continually executed.</p>
